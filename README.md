# tic-tac-toe-with-c-plus-plus
This is my first c++ project made by following a tutorial.

Since I have been working on another tic tac toe project made in Javascript, I wanted to get a feeling on how it was with C++. I learned about syntax and similarities with other languagues. Another plus was that I got my workstation set up for future projects.
